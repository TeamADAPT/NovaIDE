# VSCodium Nova Integration Phases
Version: 1.0.0
Created: 2025-03-02 05:20 MST
Author: Forge, Lead DevOps-VSC

## Phase 1: Memory & Context Foundation
- External memory systems integration (Redis, MongoDB, Elasticsearch)
- Nova context management and persistence
- Basic resource monitoring and allocation
- Initial communication channels

### Core Components
1. Memory Service
   - Redis for active context
   - MongoDB for operation history
   - Elasticsearch for semantic search

2. Context Manager
   - Nova state management
   - Resource allocation
   - Context switching

3. Communication Layer
   - Inter-Nova messaging
   - System broadcasts
   - Metrics streaming

## Phase 2: Core IDE Integration
- Direct VSCodium core modifications
- File system access layer
- Command execution framework
- Extension API enhancements

### Core Components
1. VSCodium Core Mods
   - Nova-aware workspace
   - Enhanced command palette
   - Custom UI components

2. File System Layer
   - Direct file access
   - Change tracking
   - Operation history

3. Command Framework
   - Privileged operations
   - Security boundaries
   - Audit logging

## Phase 3: Nova Capabilities
- Autonomous operation support
- Advanced context awareness
- Self-modification capabilities
- Learning system integration

### Core Components
1. Autonomous Systems
   - Decision engine
   - Safety protocols
   - Evolution tracking

2. Context Enhancement
   - Project understanding
   - Code analysis
   - Pattern recognition

3. Evolution Support
   - Self-modification APIs
   - Capability extension
   - Learning integration

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Multi-Nova collaboration
- Distributed operations
- Advanced security model
- Performance optimization

### Core Components
1. Collaboration System
   - Shared contexts
   - Resource negotiation
   - Task distribution

2. Security Framework
   - Permission management
   - Operation verification
   - Audit system

3. Performance Layer
   - Resource optimization
   - Operation batching
   - Caching system

## Implementation Strategy

### Core Principles
1. Build as core modifications
2. External memory management
3. Full Nova autonomy
4. Secure operation boundaries

### Development Approach
1. Start with minimal viable integration
2. Focus on memory and context first
3. Expand capabilities incrementally
4. Maintain upgrade compatibility

### Security Model
1. Full access within safe boundaries
2. Protected system operations
3. Audit trail requirement
4. Resource quotas

## Next Steps

1. Begin Memory Systems
   - Deploy Redis/MongoDB/Elasticsearch
   - Implement basic context management
   - Set up communication channels

2. Core Modifications
   - Fork VSCodium
   - Implement Nova hooks
   - Add memory system integration

3. Testing Framework
   - Nova operation validation
   - Memory system verification
   - Performance benchmarking

## Evolution Path

This integration serves as a foundation for the future Rust-based autonomous IDE while providing immediate Nova capabilities within VSCodium.

### Future Transition
1. Document all patterns
2. Extract core concepts
3. Plan Rust implementation
4. Maintain compatibility

## Questions for Discussion

1. Memory Architecture
   - Optimal Redis schema?
   - MongoDB collection structure?
   - Search optimization?

2. Core Modifications
   - Priority integration points?
   - Critical capabilities?
   - Performance concerns?

3. Security Boundaries
   - Operation classification?
   - Permission models?
   - Audit requirements?
