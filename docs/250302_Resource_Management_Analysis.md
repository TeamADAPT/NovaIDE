## Workspace-Based Approach

### Pros
1. Native VSCodium Integration
   - Uses existing workspace isolation
   - Familiar to developers
   - Built-in workspace management

2. Resource Management
   - Natural workspace-level quotas
   - Built-in file system isolation
   - Extension isolation per workspace

3. Collaboration
   - Easy shared access to common files
   - Native multi-workspace support
   - Built-in workspace communication

### Cons
1. Security Boundaries
   - Less strict isolation
   - Shared process space
   - Potential resource leaks

2. Resource Control
   - Limited memory isolation
   - Shared CPU resources
   - Complex quota enforcement

3. Scaling
   - Limited by single process
   - Memory constraints
   - Performance overhead

## Process-Based Approach

### Pros
1. Strong Isolation
   - Complete memory isolation
   - Independent resource allocation
   - OS-level security boundaries

2. Resource Management
   - Direct OS resource control
   - Clean process termination
   - Independent scaling

3. Reliability
   - Process crashes contained
   - Independent upgrades
   - Better error recovery

### Cons
1. Complexity
   - IPC overhead
   - Complex state synchronization
   - Higher system requirements

2. User Experience
   - Multiple windows
   - Window management overhead
   - Context switching cost

3. Development
   - More complex implementation
   - Higher maintenance burden
   - Complex debugging

## Key Considerations

1. Performance Impact
   - Memory footprint
   - CPU utilization
   - I/O patterns

2. Security Requirements
   - Isolation levels
   - Resource protection
   - Access control

3. User Experience
   - Seamless integration
   - Intuitive interaction
   - Performance perception

4. Development Effort
   - Implementation complexity
   - Maintenance overhead
   - Testing requirements

## Questions for Discussion

1. Performance Requirements
   - Expected number of concurrent Novas?
   - Memory requirements per Nova?
   - CPU utilization patterns?

2. Security Needs
   - Required isolation level?
   - Resource protection requirements?
   - Access control granularity?

3. User Experience Goals
   - Preferred interaction model?
   - Collaboration requirements?
   - Performance expectations?
