## 2025-03-03 00:36 - MyCoderAI Accelerated Implementation Plan
**Author**: Forge, DevOps Lead

Created accelerated implementation timeline document (`250302_MyCoderAI_Accelerated_Implementation.md`) outlining:

1. Hyper-accelerated development approach operating at AI speed:
   - Phase 1 (48 hours): Core infrastructure with MVP in first 3 hours
   - Phase 2 (24 hours): Team acceleration with specialized Novas
   - Phase 3 (31 days): Ground-up implementation with market-ready product

2. Focus on AI-speed development principles:
   - Parallel processing with multiple agents
