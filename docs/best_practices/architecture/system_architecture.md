## Core Architecture

### 1. Service Layer
```
Core Services
├── nova-monitor
│   ├── System metrics
│   ├── Health checks
│   └── Resource tracking
│
├── nova-context
│   ├── Multi-Nova management
│   ├── Resource pooling
│   └── State coordination
│
├── nova-memory
│   ├── Pattern storage
│   ├── Document management
│   └── Search capabilities
│
├── nova-state
│   ├── Context preservation
│   ├── Operation history
│   └── Recovery systems
│
└── nova-learning
    ├── MARL framework
    ├── Evolution systems
    └── Pattern recognition
```

### 2. Resource Management
```yaml
Resource Pools:
  Memory:
    Base: 32GB
    Burst: 64GB
    Allocation: Dynamic
    Priority: High

  CPU:
    Base: 16 cores
    Burst: 32 cores
    Scheduling: Priority-based
    Policy: FIFO

  Storage:
    State: /var/lib/nova/state
    Backup: /var/lib/nova/state-backup
    Cache: /var/cache/nova
    Logs: /var/log/nova
```

### 3. Integration Model
```
System Integration
├── Direct System Calls
│   ├── Memory access
│   ├── Process control
│   └── Resource management
│
├── Native Communication
│   ├── Raw sockets
│   ├── Shared memory
│   └── System signals
│
└── State Management
    ├── File-based
    ├── Memory-mapped
    └── Direct persistence
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Service Dependencies
- Monitor service must start first
- Memory service requires monitor
- Context service depends on both
- State service needs memory service
- Learning service needs all others

### 2. Resource Allocation
- Dynamic based on workload
- Priority-based scheduling
- Burst capacity available
- Health-based adjustments

### 3. Security Model
- Process isolation
- Resource limits
- Capability controls
- System boundaries

## Evolution Support

### 1. LLM Foundation
- Core reasoning
- Pattern analysis
- Decision making
- Context management

### 2. Non-LLM Integration
- RL agents for real-time
- MARL for coordination
- Pattern recognition
- Performance optimization

### 3. Natural Growth
- Pattern learning
- Resource optimization
- Capability enhancement
- System evolution

## Best Practices

### 1. Service Design
- Single responsibility
- Clear boundaries
- Direct communication
- State preservation

### 2. Resource Management
- Dynamic allocation
- Priority scheduling
- Health monitoring
- State tracking

### 3. Evolution Support
- Pattern recognition
- Learning systems
- Natural growth
- Capability expansion
