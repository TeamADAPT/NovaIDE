**Version:** 0.1.0

## Technical Architecture

The MyCoderAI system is designed with a modular, microservices-based architecture that enables autonomous development with optional human involvement. This document details the technical implementation.

### Core Components

#### 1. Agent Orchestration System

The orchestrator (`agent/orchestrator.js`) manages multiple specialized AI agents working in parallel. It handles:

- Agent lifecycle management (creation, registration, task assignment)
- Task planning and distribution
- Inter-agent communication routing
- Conflict resolution
- Resource allocation
- Progress tracking and reporting

The orchestrator uses a type-based agent distribution model, creating agents with specialized roles:
- Architects: System design and planning
- Coders: Implementation
- Testers: Validation
- Documenters: Documentation generation
- Reviewers: Code review and optimization

Task execution follows a dependency-based workflow where subtasks are assigned to appropriate agents based on their type and current availability.

#### 2. Memory Architecture

The memory system (`memory/memoryManager.js`) provides shared context and knowledge across components:

- Short-term working memory (in-process Maps)
- Long-term persistence (SQLite database)
- Optional Redis integration for larger deployments
- Scope-based memory partitioning:
  - Global: System-wide information
  - Task: Task-specific context
  - Agent: Agent-specific data 
  - Interaction: User interaction history

Memory operations are transactional and provide both in-memory caching and disk persistence with automatic synchronization.

#### 3. Communication Protocol

The communication hub (`communication/hub.js`) standardizes all message passing:

- Pub/sub event system
- Socket.IO integration for real-time updates
- Message queuing for disconnected agents
- Prioritized message delivery
- Broadcast channels by topic
- Structured message format
- Historical message storage

The hub implements both direct agent-to-agent communication and channel-based broadcasts, maintaining message history for recovery and auditing.

#### 4. Execution Environment

The execution environment (`execution/environment.js`) provides secure code execution:

- Sandboxed runtime with resource limits
- Multiple language support (JavaScript, Python, Shell)
- Docker-based isolation (when available)
- Process-based fallback execution
- File system access controls
- Execution metrics and monitoring

All code execution is isolated and monitored, with configurable timeouts and resource limits to prevent runaway processes.

#### 5. User Interface

The UI system (`ui/server.js`) enables human observation and interaction:

- Express-based API server
- Socket.IO for real-time updates
- React-based frontend
- Responsive dashboard
- Task monitoring
- Agent management
- Intervention points
- Configuration options

The UI allows observers to monitor progress, intervene when necessary, and configure system behavior.

## System Integration

Components communicate via events and direct method calls, with the following primary integration points:

1. Agent Orchestrator ↔ Memory Manager
   - Task state persistence
   - Agent context retrieval
   - Plan storage and retrieval

2. Agent Orchestrator ↔ Communication Hub
   - Agent registration
   - Message delivery
   - Event forwarding

3. Agent Orchestrator ↔ Execution Environment
   - Code execution requests
   - Execution result processing

4. UI Server ↔ All Components
   - Status monitoring
   - Configuration management
   - User intervention routing

## Security Model

The system implements multiple security layers:

1. **Execution Isolation**
   - Docker-based sandboxing (when available)
   - Process isolation with resource limits
   - File system access restrictions
   - Execution timeouts

2. **API Security**
   - Input validation
   - Parameter sanitization
   - Error handling and logging

3. **Resource Protection**
   - Memory usage limits
   - CPU usage throttling
   - Storage quotas

## Performance Considerations

The system is designed to balance performance and resource usage:

1. **Memory Management**
   - Two-tier memory model (in-memory + persistent)
   - Automatic memory reclamation for large datasets
   - Efficient serialization/deserialization

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Agent parallelism based on available resources
   - Task-level concurrency
   - Dependency-based execution scheduling

3. **Resource Monitoring**
   - System metrics collection
   - Resource usage tracking
   - Adaptive resource allocation

## Extensibility

The system is designed for easy extension in several ways:

1. **Agent Types**
   - New agent types can be added by extending the orchestrator's agent type definitions
   - Custom agent behaviors can be implemented

2. **Language Support**
   - New language execution can be added to the execution environment 
   - Custom language-specific tools can be integrated

3. **UI Customization**
   - The frontend is template-based and can be customized
   - Additional visualization components can be added

4. **Integration Points**
   - Event-based architecture allows for easy integration with external systems
   - API endpoints can be extended for additional functionality

## Deployment Model

The system is designed for flexible deployment:

1. **Development Environment**
   - Local execution with minimal dependencies
   - In-memory storage option for rapid iteration

2. **Production Environment**
   - Docker-based deployment
   - Redis for distributed memory
   - Scalable agent pool
   - Persistent storage for long-running tasks

## Technical Debt and Limitations

Current implementation limitations include:

1. **Agent Intelligence**
   - The MVP uses simplified agent logic
   - Future versions will integrate with LLMs for true intelligence

2. **Scalability**
   - Current implementation is single-process
   - Distributed execution requires additional work

3. **Security**
   - Basic sandboxing is implemented
   - Production deployment would require enhanced security measures

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Limited error recovery capabilities in the MVP
   - More sophisticated error handling needed for production

## Next Steps

Technical evolution path:

1. Integrate with LangChain/LangGraph for agent intelligence
2. Implement distributed agent execution
3. Enhance security model for production deployment
4. Add sophisticated error recovery mechanisms
5. Develop advanced visualization capabilities
6. Implement project template system
7. Add version control integration
8. Develop enhanced testing capabilities
