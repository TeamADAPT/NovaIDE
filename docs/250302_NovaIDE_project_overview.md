## Project Description
NovaIDE is an autonomous, multi-agent integrated development environment built on VSCodium. It combines advanced AI capabilities with traditional IDE features to create a seamless development experience powered by multiple Nova agents.

## Core Components

### 1. Base Platform
- Modified VSCodium fork
- Direct system integration
- Multi-Nova support architecture
- Enhanced security model

### 2. AI Integration
- Multiple Nova agents
- LangGraph + AutoGen integration
- Vector-based memory systems
- CRDT for collaboration

### 3. Development Features
- AI-driven code generation
- Self-debugging capabilities
- Autonomous testing
- Mutation testing support

### 4. System Architecture
- Microservices-based design
- Event-driven communication
- Redis/Kafka coordination
- eBPF/sandboxing for execution

## Technology Stack
