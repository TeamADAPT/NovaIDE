# VSCodium Integration Phases

*Version: 1.1.0*  
*Date: 2025-03-02 21:40 MST*  
*Author: Forge, DevOps Lead*

## Overview

This document outlines the updated, accelerated plan for transitioning from VSCode to VSCodium within the NovaIDE project. **This plan has been prioritized** following resource management issues with isolated VSCode instances that required emergency termination.

## Motivation

The recent resource management issues with isolated VSCode instances have highlighted the need for a more robust, resource-efficient solution. VSCodium offers several advantages:

1. Reduced telemetry overhead
2. Lower baseline resource consumption
3. Improved isolation capabilities
4. Enhanced security through open-source validation
5. Compatible with our existing extension ecosystem
6. Better control over update and release management

## Phase 0: Immediate Stabilization (Completed)

- ✅ Emergency termination of problematic Forge VSCode instance
- ✅ Cleanup of isolated instance directories
- ✅ Service disabling and masking
- ✅ Documentation of lessons learned

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Accelerated Timeline)

**Target Completion: March 3, 2025**

### Infrastructure Preparation
- Install VSCodium from official repositories
- Verify installation integrity
- Set up base configuration directory structure:
  ```
  ~/.config/VSCodium/              # Base configuration
  ~/.config/VSCodium-Isolated/     # Instance directory
  ~/vsc-extensions/vscodium/       # Extensions directory
  ```

### Resource Management Framework
- Implement enhanced resource monitoring:
  - CPU usage caps through systemd and cgroups
  - Memory limits with built-in garbage collection triggers
  - File watcher limits and optimization
  - Process priority management
- Create automated health check system:
  - Resource consumption monitoring
  - Crash detection and recovery
  - Graceful termination protocols
- Develop pre-flight environment checks:
  - System resource availability verification
  - Conflict detection with existing instances
  - Dependencies validation

### Configuration Framework
- Establish base configuration templates:
  - Default settings.json
  - Default keybindings.json
  - Default extensions.json
- Create instance configuration isolation:
  - Environment variable separation
  - Process isolation
  - IPC namespace isolation

## Phase 2: Migration Implementation

**Target Completion: March 7, 2025**

### Migration Tooling Enhancement
- Enhance existing migration script (`src/migrations/vscodium_migrate.sh`):
  - Add resource constraint parameters
  - Implement health check integration
  - Add rollback capabilities
  - Include detailed logging
- Create validation tools:
  - Settings verification
  - Extension compatibility check
  - Performance benchmarking

### System Service Integration
- Create systemd service templates:
  - Base VSCodium service
  - Nova-specific isolated services:
    - vscodium-vaeris.service
    - vscodium-theseus.service
  - Monitoring and recovery services
- Implement shared service configuration:
  - Resource limits
  - Dependency chains
  - Startup/shutdown sequences
  - Crash recovery

### Test Migration
- Perform controlled migration of test instance:
  - Settings transfer validation
  - Extension functionality verification
  - Resource usage monitoring
  - Performance comparison with VSCode

## Phase 3: Agent Adaptation

**Target Completion: March 10, 2025**

### Agent Framework Adaptation
- Adapt agent initialization scripts
- Update Nova core extensions for VSCodium
- Implement enhanced resource monitoring hooks
- Create agent recovery mechanisms

### Communication Layer
- Test inter-agent communication
- Verify MCP integration
- Validate stream communication

### Agent Environment Testing
- Deploy test agents in VSCodium environment
- Monitor resource consumption patterns
- Test isolated workspaces
- Verify isolation boundaries

## Phase 4: Full Deployment

**Target Completion: March 14, 2025**

### Production Migration
- Migrate production instances
- Transfer all agent configurations
- Enable monitoring and reporting
- Activate recovery systems

### Documentation
- Update all procedures and documentation
- Create VSCodium-specific troubleshooting guide
- Document resource optimization strategies
- Provide configuration reference

### Training
- Provide team briefing on changes
- Document migration lessons learned
- Create VSCodium best practices guide

## Resource Management Improvements

Following the recent VSCode instance issues, we've identified these key improvements for the VSCodium implementation:

### Process Isolation
- Use systemd slices for process grouping
- Implement namespace isolation where possible
- Maintain separate extension directories
- Enforce environment variable separation

### Resource Constraints
- Apply strict cgroup limits:
  ```
  CPUQuota=50%
  MemoryLimit=2G
  TasksMax=200
  ```
- Implement JS heap size limitations
- Configure file watcher limits
- Set extension resource budgets

### Health Monitoring
- Create real-time resource monitoring
- Implement early warning system for resource spikes
- Develop automatic recovery for non-responsive instances
- Create graceful termination protocols

### Pre-flight Checks
- Verify system resource availability before launch
- Check for conflicting instances
- Validate configuration integrity
- Test extension compatibility

## Migration Validation Checklist

Before migrating each instance, verify:

- [ ] Base VSCodium runs without issues
- [ ] All required extensions are compatible
- [ ] Settings transfer correctly
- [ ] Keybindings function as expected
- [ ] Resource monitoring is active
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms are tested
- [ ] User data is properly isolated
- [ ] MCP servers connect properly

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Extension incompatibility | Medium | High | Pre-test all extensions, maintain compatibility list |
| Resource leaks | Low | High | Implement strict monitoring, automatic recovery |
| Configuration corruption | Low | Medium | Backup all configs, checksums, version control |
| Performance regression | Medium | Medium | Benchmark before/after, optimize settings |
| Agent communication failure | Low | High | Comprehensive testing, fallback mechanisms |

## Next Steps

1. Immediately begin VSCodium installation and base configuration
2. Enhance migration scripts with resource management capabilities
3. Create test environments with monitoring
4. Begin controlled migration of non-critical instances
