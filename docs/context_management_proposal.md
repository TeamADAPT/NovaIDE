# Context Management System Proposal
Version: 1.0.0
Created: 2025-03-02 00:35 MST
Author: Forge

## Overview
This proposal outlines a system for managing Nova context windows to prevent overload while maintaining operational effectiveness.

## Current Challenges
1. Context window fills up during complex operations
2. No systematic way to manage context size
3. Risk of freezes or degraded performance
4. Loss of important context during resets

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Context Monitoring System
```typescript
interface ContextMetrics {
    currentSize: number;
    maxSize: number;
    utilizationPercent: number;
    warningThresholds: number[];
    components: {
        memory: number;
        instructions: number;
        conversation: number;
        activeTask: number;
    }
}
```

- Implement real-time context size tracking
- Set warning thresholds at 70%, 80%, 90%
- Log metrics for analysis
- Alert when approaching thresholds

### 2. Smart Context Management

#### Priority Levels
```typescript
enum ContextPriority {
    CRITICAL,    // Core instructions, active task
    HIGH,        // Recent conversation context
    MEDIUM,      // Background context
    LOW         // Historical data
}
```

#### Pruning Strategy
1. Maintain critical context at all times
2. Compress or summarize historical data
3. Archive low-priority context to Memory Bank
4. Keep sliding window of recent interactions

### 3. Chunked Processing System

#### Task Chunking
```typescript
interface TaskChunk {
    id: string;
    priority: ContextPriority;
    dependencies: string[];
    state: {
        completed: boolean;
        contextSize: number;
        memoryKeys: string[];
    }
}
```

- Break large tasks into manageable chunks
- Maintain state between chunks
- Use Memory Bank for persistence
- Implement chunk scheduling

### 4. Context Optimization

#### Compression Strategies
1. Remove redundant information
2. Compress verbose data structures
3. Use references instead of full content
4. Implement efficient encoding

#### Memory Bank Integration
1. Store large datasets in Memory Bank
2. Use references in active context
3. Implement lazy loading
4. Cache frequently accessed data

## Implementation Phases
