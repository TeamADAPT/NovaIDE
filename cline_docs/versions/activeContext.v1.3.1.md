## Current Work Status

### VSCodium Build and Integration

I have been working on building VSCodium from source and integrating it with our isolation system. This work includes:

1. **Build Environment Setup:**
   - Modified `scripts/vscodium_build_env.sh` to handle existing symlinks
   - Added `--force` flag to npm install to handle existing packages
   - Updated isolation script to check for VSCodium binary

2. **Build Attempts:**
   - Attempted to build VSCodium using `scripts/build_vscodium.sh`
   - Encountered issues with patches not applying correctly
   - Modified `scripts/vscodium_isolation.sh` to fall back to VS Code if VSCodium is not available

3. **Current Status:**
   - VSCodium build is not yet successful due to patch application issues
   - Isolation script has been updated to handle both VSCodium and VS Code
   - Working on alternative approaches to get VSCodium running

### VSCodium Window Isolation Implementation

I have successfully implemented VSCodium window isolation to enable running multiple isolated VSCodium instances for Nova agents. This implementation includes:

1. **Isolation Scripts and Services:**
   - Created `scripts/vscodium_isolation.sh` for launching isolated VSCodium instances
   - Created systemd service template `systemd/vscodium@.service` for agent-specific services
   - Created target file `systemd/vscodium-instances.target` for managing all instances
   - Created monitoring service `systemd/vscodium-monitor.service`

2. **Deployment and Monitoring Tools:**
   - Created `scripts/deploy_vscodium_agents.sh` for deploying instances for multiple agents
   - Created `scripts/monitor_vscodium_instances.sh` for monitoring resource usage and crashes
   - Created `config/nova_agents.txt` with sample agent configuration

3. **Documentation:**
   - Created `docs/VSCodium_Deployment_QuickStart.md` with step-by-step deployment guide
   - Updated `docs/operations_history.md` to document the implementation

This implementation enables running VSCodium instances for all 222 Nova agents with proper isolation, resource management, and monitoring.
