## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Core Architecture
- Microservices-based design
- Event-driven communication
- CQRS pattern for state management
- Hexagonal architecture for core services

### 2. Integration Patterns
- Adapter pattern for VSCodium integration
- Observer pattern for event handling
- Strategy pattern for Nova behaviors
- Factory pattern for service creation

### 3. Communication Patterns
- Pub/Sub for event distribution
- CRDT for collaborative editing
- Message queues for async operations
- Streaming for large data handling

### 4. Data Patterns
- Repository pattern for data access
- Vector storage for embeddings
- Cache-aside for performance
- Event sourcing for history

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Base Platform
- VSCodium fork as foundation
- TypeScript for core development
- Rust for performance-critical components
- Python for AI/ML integration

### 2. Storage Solutions
- Redis for caching/coordination
- Vector databases for embeddings
- PostgreSQL for structured data
- S3-compatible for artifacts

### 3. Communication Infrastructure
- Kafka for event streaming
- gRPC for service communication
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- REST for external APIs

### 4. Development Tools
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring
