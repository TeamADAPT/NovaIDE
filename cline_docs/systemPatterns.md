## Architecture Patterns

### Microservices Architecture
The MyCoderAI system follows a microservices architecture pattern, with clear component boundaries and specialized responsibilities:

1. **Core Components as Services**
   - Agent Orchestrator
   - Memory Manager
   - Communication Hub
   - Execution Environment
   - UI Server

2. **Event-Driven Communication**
   - Components communicate via events
   - Publish-subscribe pattern for notifications
   - Command pattern for direct operations

3. **Layered Architecture**
   - Presentation layer (UI)
   - Business logic layer (Orchestration)
   - Data management layer (Memory)
   - Infrastructure layer (Execution)

### Agent-Based Design
The system employs an agent-based design pattern where multiple specialized agents collaborate on tasks:

1. **Agent Specialization**
   - Agents have specific roles and capabilities
   - Clear responsibility boundaries
   - Capability-based task assignment

2. **Orchestration Pattern**
   - Central coordinator manages agent lifecycle
   - Task planning and distribution
   - Dependency management
   - Conflict resolution

3. **Autonomous Operation**
   - Agents make independent decisions within their domain
   - Self-contained processing
   - Coordination through shared context

### Memory Management
The system employs a multi-tier memory architecture:

1. **Repository Pattern**
   - Abstract data access through repositories
   - Consistent interface regardless of storage mechanism
   - Transaction support

2. **Cache-Aside Pattern**
   - In-memory caching for performance
   - Persistent storage for durability
   - Automatic synchronization

3. **Scope-Based Organization**
   - Global scope for system-wide information
   - Task scope for task-specific context
   - Agent scope for agent-specific data
   - Interaction scope for user interactions

## Technical Decisions

### Programming Language and Runtime
- **Node.js with Express**
  - Rationale: Event-driven architecture aligns with system requirements
  - Strong ecosystem for web servers and real-time communication
  - Efficient for I/O operations

### Data Storage
- **In-Memory + SQLite + Optional Redis**
  - In-memory for performance-critical operations
  - SQLite for durability without external dependencies
  - Redis option for distributed deployments
  - Rationale: Balances performance, simplicity, and deployment flexibility

### Communication
- **Socket.IO for Real-Time**
  - WebSocket-based communication
  - Fallback mechanisms for compatibility
  - Channel-based messaging
  - Rationale: Mature library with broad support and reliability

### Code Execution
- **Multi-Level Isolation**
  - Docker containers (when available)
  - Process-based isolation (fallback)
  - Resource limiting
  - Rationale: Balance between security and deployment flexibility

### User Interface
- **Express + React**
  - Server-side API with Express
  - Client-side rendering with React
  - Socket.IO for real-time updates
  - Rationale: Separation of concerns, modern UI capabilities

## Integration Points

### External System Interfaces

1. **LLM API Integration**
   - Integration point for agent intelligence
   - API abstraction layer planned
   - Support for multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

2. **Version Control System**
   - Future integration point for project persistence
   - Git-based storage planned
   - Commit/branch management capabilities

3. **Development Toolchains**
   - Future integration with external build tools
   - Package managers (npm, pip, etc.)
   - Testing frameworks

### Internal Component Interfaces

1. **Agent Orchestrator ↔ Memory Manager**
   - Task state persistence
   - Agent context management
   - Plan storage and retrieval

2. **Agent Orchestrator ↔ Communication Hub**
   - Agent registration
   - Message routing
   - Event broadcasting

3. **Agent Orchestrator ↔ Execution Environment**
   - Code execution requests
   - Execution result processing
   - Resource allocation

4. **UI Server ↔ All Components**
   - Status monitoring
   - Configuration interface
   - Intervention handling
