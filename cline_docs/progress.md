   - Establishing event flow between systems
   - Implementing common error handling

2. **Agent Intelligence**
   - Preparing for LLM API integration
   - Defining agent prompts and behaviors
   - Creating agent specialization logic

3. **UI Enhancement**
   - Developing visualization components
   - Implementing real-time updates
   - Creating intervention interfaces

### Current Metrics:
- **Components Implemented:** 3/5 (60%)
- **Test Coverage:** Initial tests implemented
- **Documentation Status:** Core documentation complete

## Next Steps

### Immediate Focus (Next 48 Hours)
1. **Complete Memory Management Implementation**

   - Connect with SQLite for persistence
   - Implement memory scoping (global/task/agent)

2. **Complete Agent Orchestration**
   - Implement Agent Orchestrator (agent/orchestrator.js)
   - Implement agent lifecycle management
   - Create task distribution system
   - Implement conflict resolution

3. **Enhance UI Visualization**
   - Complete frontend React implementation
