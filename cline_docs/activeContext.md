# MyCoderAI Active Context
**Version:** 0.1.1
**Date:** 2025-03-03
**Author:** Forge, DevOps Lead

## Current Work Status

The MyCoderAI project is currently in Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development phase. The core architecture has been defined and the initial implementation of key components has been completed. We are working within a 3-hour accelerated implementation timeframe to demonstrate the foundational capabilities of an AI-driven autonomous development system.

### Component Status

1. **Agent Orchestration System:** 
   - Core implementation complete
   - Agent lifecycle management implemented
   - Task distribution and assignment functional
   - Conflict resolution system implemented
   - Needs integration with real AI agents

2. **Memory Architecture:**
   - Two-tier memory system implemented (in-memory + persistent)
   - SQLite persistence layer functional
   - Redis integration ready (optional)
   - Memory scoping (global/task/agent/interaction) implemented

3. **Communication Protocol:**
   - Event-based message passing system implemented
   - Channel-based broadcasting functional
   - Socket.IO integration for real-time updates
   - Message prioritization and routing implemented

4. **Execution Environment:**
   - Secure code execution with isolation implemented
   - Docker-based sandbox available when possible
   - Process-based fallback execution implemented
   - Multiple language support functioning

5. **User Interface:**
   - Express-based API server implemented
   - Socket.IO for real-time updates integrated
   - Basic React frontend with dashboard created
   - Intervention points defined and exposed

## Recent Changes

1. Refactored TesterAgent to modular architecture for improved maintainability
2. Core project architecture defined and documented
3. Directory structure created with component separation
4. Package.json with dependencies defined
5. Core implementation of all main components:
   - Agent Orchestrator (agent/orchestrator.js)
   - Memory Manager (memory/memoryManager.js)
   - Communication Hub (communication/hub.js)
   - Execution Environment (execution/environment.js)
   - UI Server (ui/server.js)
6. Project documentation created:
   - Architecture documentation
   - Overview documentation
   - Memory bank files

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Hours)

1. **Integrate with LLM APIs**
   - Connect agent system to actual language models
   - Define agent prompts and behaviors
   - Implement specialized agent types (architect, coder, etc.)

2. **Enhance UI Visualization**
   - Complete frontend implementation
   - Implement real-time progress visualization
   - Add intervention UI elements

3. **Add Task Templates**
   - Create predefined task types
   - Define task workflows
   - Implement task parsing system

### Short-term (Next Week)

1. **Add Testing Framework**
   - Implement unit tests for core components
   - Create integration test suite
   - Develop performance benchmarks

2. **Enhance Security Model**
   - Improve sandbox isolation
   - Add permission system
   - Implement audit logging

3. **Implement Project Management**
   - Add project templates
   - Create project persistence
   - Support multi-project workflows

### Medium-term (Next Month)

1. **Distributed Architecture**
   - Convert to microservices
   - Implement container orchestration
   - Add horizontal scaling capability

2. **Advanced Agent Capabilities**
   - Implement learning from feedback
   - Add domain-specific specializations
   - Create advanced planning capabilities

## Team Coordination
