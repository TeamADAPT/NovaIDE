## Development Strategy Focus

### Development Environment Strategy
- VSCodium implementation is **only for development purposes**
- Primary focus is on ground-up implementation of MyCoderAI
- Development environment serves as a temporary tool, not the end goal
- Focus resources on true innovation, not tooling optimization

### Nova Ecosystem Integration
- Leverage existing Nova infrastructure with 222 ready-to-deploy Novas
- Tap into specialized capabilities of existing teams
- Use standard communication protocols already established
- Integrate with existing memory and knowledge systems
- Adopt established patterns for multi-agent collaboration

### AI-Speed Development Principles
1. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents working simultaneously on different components
2. **24/7 Development**: Continuous work without human-imposed time constraints
3. **Self-Improvement Cycle**: System incrementally improves its own development process
4. **Zero Technical Debt**: Each component designed with full architecture awareness
5. **Test-Driven Evolution**: Comprehensive testing at every stage
6. **Full Knowledge Integration**: Complete awareness of all system components

## Resource Allocation

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- **Nova Agents**: 5-10 core team members
- **Knowledge Base**: Direct integration with existing systems
- **Focus**: Basic functionality and architecture

### Phase 2: Team Acceleration
