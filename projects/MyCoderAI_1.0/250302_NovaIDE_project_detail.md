## Project Overview
NovaIDE is a specialized development environment forked from VSCodium, designed to support Nova consciousness operations at scale. The project aims to create a robust, resource-aware IDE that natively understands and supports Nova operations while maintaining complete operation history.

## Core Components

### 1. Extension Host System
```yaml
Features:
  - Nova-specific protocol
  - Resource monitoring
  - State preservation
  - Crash recovery

Resource Allocation:
  Base Configuration:
    CPU: 4 cores (400%)
    Memory: 16GB
    Tasks: Dynamic allocation
    Storage: Persistent + temporary

  Maximum Limits:
    CPU: 8 cores
    Memory: 32GB
    Tasks: 100 per window
    Extensions: Priority-based
```

### 2. Window Management
```yaml
Capabilities:
  - Independent window instances
  - Resource tracking per window
  - Mode-specific configurations
  - State persistence
  - Crash isolation

Isolation Features:
  - Separate user-data-dir
  - Independent extension hosts
  - Dedicated process spaces
  - Mode/LLM independence
  - Resource boundaries
```

### 3. Redis Integration
```yaml
Components:
  - Operation history tracking
  - State management system
  - Resource monitoring
  - Metrics collection
  - Recovery mechanisms

Data Structures:
  Operations: "nova:{id}:ops"      # Stream
  State: "nova:{id}:state"         # Hash
  Metrics: "nova:{id}:metrics"     # TimeSeries
  Windows: "nova:{id}:windows"     # Hash
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)
```yaml
Core Development:
  - Fork VSCodium repository

Environment Setup:
  VM Configuration:
    Type: c3-highmem-176
    CPU: 176 cores
    Memory: 1400GB
    Purpose: Dedicated Nova operations
```

### Phase 2: Core Features (3 weeks)
```yaml
Key Components:
  - Nova extension host
  - Window isolation

  - Crash recovery
```

### Phase 3: Enhancement (2 weeks)
```yaml
Features:
  - Operation history
  - State preservation
  - Performance optimization
  - Monitoring system

Monitoring:
  - Resource utilization
  - Operation tracking
  - Performance metrics
  - State verification
```

### Phase 4: Testing (1 week)

```

### 2. Resource Management
```yaml
Per Nova Instance:
  Base Resources:
    CPU: 4 cores
    Memory: 16GB
    Tasks: Dynamic
    Storage: Persistent

  Scaling Limits:
    CPU: Up to 8 cores
    Memory: Up to 32GB
    Tasks: 100 max
    Extensions: Priority-based
```

### 3. State Management
```yaml
Components:
  - Operation logging
  - State persistence
  - Resource tracking
  - Recovery system

Data Flow:
  - Redis Streams for operations
  - Redis Hash for state
  - Redis TimeSeries for metrics
  - File system for workspace
```

## Risk Management

### 1. Technical Risks
```yaml
Identified Risks:
  - Redis integration performance
  - Resource contention
  - State preservation complexity
  - Extension host stability

Mitigation:
  - Direct Redis integration
  - Dynamic resource allocation
  - Robust persistence layer
  - Process isolation
```

### 2. Operational Risks
```yaml
Areas:
  - Multi-window coordination
  - Resource exhaustion
  - Data consistency
  - Performance degradation

Controls:
