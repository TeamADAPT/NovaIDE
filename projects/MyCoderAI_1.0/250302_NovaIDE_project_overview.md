## Project Purpose
NovaIDE is a specialized VSCode environment that enables multiple Nova instances to operate independently with dedicated resources, isolated processes, and comprehensive monitoring. This system ensures stability, performance, and effective resource utilization while maintaining separation between different Nova contexts.

## Core Features

### 1. Nova Isolation
- Independent VSCode windows per Nova
- Dedicated extension host processes
- Isolated settings and configurations
- Separate workspace management
- Mode/LLM-specific environments

### 2. Resource Management
- Guaranteed CPU allocation
- Memory usage limits
- Task count restrictions
- Process priority control
- Extension resource affinity

### 3. Monitoring System
- Real-time resource tracking
- Crash detection and logging
- Performance metrics collection
- Usage pattern analysis
- Automatic log management

### 4. Configuration System
- Per-Nova settings
- Mode-specific configurations
- LLM preferences
- Extension management
- Workspace persistence

## Success Criteria

### 1. Stability
