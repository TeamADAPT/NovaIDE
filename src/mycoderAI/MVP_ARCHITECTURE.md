# MyCoderAI MVP Architecture
**Version:** 0.1.0
**Date:** 2025-03-03
**Author:** Forge, DevOps Lead

## Overview
This document outlines the core architecture for the MyCoderAI Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to be developed within the 3-hour accelerated implementation timeframe. The MVP will demonstrate the revolutionary concept of AI-driven autonomous development with optional human involvement.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Orchestration System
- **Purpose:** Coordinate multiple specialized AI agents working in parallel
- **Key Features:**
  - Dynamic agent allocation
  - Task distribution and prioritization
  - Progress tracking
  - Conflict resolution
  - Resource management

### 2. Memory Architecture
- **Purpose:** Provide shared context and knowledge across agents
- **Key Components:**
  - Short-term working memory
  - Long-term knowledge store
  - Context management
  - Inter-agent memory protocol
  - Project state persistence

### 3. User Interface
- **Purpose:** Allow human observation and optional interaction
- **Features:**
  - Development progress visualization
  - Intervention points
  - Decision observation
  - Configuration interface
  - Progress metrics

### 4. Execution Environment
- **Purpose:** Provide sandboxed runtime for generated code
- **Features:**
  - Isolated execution
  - Resource monitoring
  - Output validation
  - Error handling
  - Dependency management

### 5. Communication Protocol
- **Purpose:** Define standard for agent interaction
- **Key Aspects:**
  - Message format
  - Routing rules
  - Priority levels
  - Error handling
  - State synchronization

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Hour 1)
- Create agent orchestration framework
- Implement minimal memory architecture
- Set up basic communication protocol
- Establish execution environment
- Create shell user interface

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Hour 2)
- Implement agent specialization system
- Enhance memory with persistence
- Add basic decision visualization
- Enable primitive human intervention
- Implement core task handling

### Phase 3: Integration (Hour 3)
- Connect all components
- Implement end-to-end workflow
- Add minimal error recovery
- Create demonstration capabilities
- Document extensibility points

## Success Criteria
The MVP will be considered successful if it demonstrates:

1. Multiple AI agents collaborating on a simple development task
2. Shared memory and context across agents
3. Basic user interface for observation
4. Ability to execute generated code in isolation
5. Human intervention capability at critical decision points
6. End-to-end completion of a simple programming task

## Technology Stack
- Agent Framework: Python-based with LangChain/LangGraph
- Memory System: Redis for shared state, SQLite for persistence
- User Interface: Web-based with React
- Execution Environment: Containerized with Docker
- Communication: REST API with WebSocket for real-time updates

## Next Steps
Upon completion of the MVP, the focus will immediately shift to:
1. Expanding agent capabilities
2. Enhancing memory architecture
3. Improving user experience
4. Adding advanced visualization
5. Supporting complex project structures
