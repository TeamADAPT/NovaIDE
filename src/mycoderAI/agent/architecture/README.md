# Architecture Module

This directory contains the modular architecture components for the ArchitectAgent in MyCoderAI.

## Overview

The architecture module is organized into four main categories:

1. **Design**: Modules for creating system designs and component structures
2. **Analysis**: Modules for analyzing requirements and reviewing architecture
3. **Planning**: Modules for breaking down tasks and planning development
4. **Documentation**: Modules for generating architecture documentation

## Modules

### Design Modules

#### SystemDesigner

Responsible for creating system designs based on requirements, identifying components, creating interfaces between components, and defining data flows.

```javascript
const { SystemDesigner } = require('../architecture');
const systemDesigner = new SystemDesigner(config, services);
const design = await systemDesigner.designSystem(requirements, options);
```

#### ComponentStructurer

Responsible for creating component structures based on system design, generating directory structures, component files, interface files, and build system configuration.

```javascript
const { ComponentStructurer } = require('../architecture');
const componentStructurer = new ComponentStructurer(config, services);
const structure = await componentStructurer.createComponentStructure(design, options);
```

### Analysis Modules

#### RequirementsAnalyzer

Responsible for analyzing requirements for a system, categorizing requirements, identifying dependencies between requirements, and assessing completeness and clarity.

```javascript
const { RequirementsAnalyzer } = require('../architecture');
const requirementsAnalyzer = new RequirementsAnalyzer(config, services);
const analysis = await requirementsAnalyzer.analyzeRequirements(requirements, options);
```

#### ArchitectureReviewer

Responsible for reviewing architecture for quality and issues, calculating quality metrics, identifying architectural issues, and generating recommendations.

```javascript
const { ArchitectureReviewer } = require('../architecture');
const architectureReviewer = new ArchitectureReviewer(config, services);
const review = await architectureReviewer.reviewArchitecture(design, options);
```

### Planning Modules

#### TaskPlanner

Responsible for breaking down tasks based on system design, defining development phases, creating implementation tasks, establishing task dependencies, and estimating effort and critical path.

```javascript
const { TaskPlanner } = require('../architecture');
const taskPlanner = new TaskPlanner(config, services);
const taskBreakdown = await taskPlanner.breakdownTasks(design, componentStructure, options);
```

### Documentation Modules

#### ArchitectureDocumenter

Responsible for generating architecture documentation, creating overview sections, documenting components and interfaces, describing data flows, and recording design decisions.

```javascript
const { ArchitectureDocumenter } = require('../architecture');
const architectureDocumenter = new ArchitectureDocumenter(config, services);
const documentation = await architectureDocumenter.documentArchitecture(design, options);
```

## Integration with ArchitectAgent

The ArchitectAgent class uses these modules to provide a unified interface for architecture-related tasks. The agent initializes all modules in its constructor and delegates tasks to the appropriate module.

```javascript
const ArchitectAgent = require('./architectAgent');
const agent = new ArchitectAgent(config, services);
```

## Configuration

Each module accepts a configuration object in its constructor, allowing for customization of its behavior. The configuration object is passed to the module by the ArchitectAgent.

```javascript
const config = {
  systemDesigner: {
    // SystemDesigner-specific configuration
  },
  componentStructurer: {
    // ComponentStructurer-specific configuration
  },
  // ...
};

const agent = new ArchitectAgent(config, services);
```

## Services

Each module also accepts a services object in its constructor, providing access to shared services like memory management, communication, and LLM integration.

```javascript
const services = {
  memoryManager: memoryManager,
  communicationHub: communicationHub,
  // ...
};

const agent = new ArchitectAgent(config, services);
