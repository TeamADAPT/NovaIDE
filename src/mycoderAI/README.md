# MyCoderAI

A fully autonomous AI development environment designed to revolutionize coding workflows.

## Overview

MyCoderAI is a comprehensive platform that enables AI agents to collaborate on coding tasks autonomously. By leveraging a microservices architecture, MyCoderAI provides a flexible, extensible framework for AI-driven software development.

## Architecture

MyCoderAI is built using a microservices architecture with the following core components:

- **Core Services**: Fundamental components that manage agent orchestration, memory, and task distribution
- **Communication Hub**: Enables seamless messaging between agent services
- **Execution Environment**: Secure sandbox for code execution and testing
- **UI Server**: Visual interface for monitoring and interacting with the system
- **Memory Management**: Shared context and persistent knowledge storage
- **Agent Services**: Specialized AI agents for different aspects of software development
