### Semantic Versioning System Implementation

Implemented a comprehensive semantic versioning system for project files:

1. Created versioning directory structure:
   - `cline_docs/versions/` for Memory Bank files
   - `docs/versions/` for documentation files
   - Preserved original files at their original locations

2. Archived current versions of key files:
   - Memory Bank files (activeContext.md, productContext.md, progress.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md)
   - Operations history (operations_history.md)
   - Each file archived with its current version number in the filename

3. Created versioning automation:
   - `scripts/version_file.sh` script for automating the versioning process
   - Handles archiving current version before updating
   - Updates version numbers and timestamps automatically
   - Maintains proper directory structure

4. Created versioning documentation:
   - `docs/250303_File_Versioning_Guide.md` with comprehensive guidelines
   - Semantic versioning principles (Major.Minor.Patch)
   - Best practices for file versioning
   - Example workflow for versioning files

This implementation ensures that all file changes are properly versioned and archived, maintaining a complete history of changes while preserving the latest version for easy access. The system follows semantic versioning principles, with version numbers reflecting the nature of changes (major, minor, patch).

### VSCodium Build Troubleshooting

Attempted to build VSCodium from source but encountered issues with patch application:

1. Modified build environment script to improve reliability:
   - Updated `scripts/vscodium_build_env.sh` to handle existing symlinks
   - Added `--force` flag to npm install to handle existing packages
   - Fixed script structure and error handling

2. Attempted VSCodium build with modified scripts:
   - Used `scripts/build_vscodium.sh` to build VSCodium in isolated environment
   - Successfully set up build environment with required dependencies
   - Encountered issues with patches not applying correctly

3. Implemented fallback mechanism in isolation script:
   - Modified `scripts/vscodium_isolation.sh` to check for VSCodium binary
   - Added fallback to VS Code if VSCodium is not available
   - Ensured isolation script works with both VSCodium and VS Code

This work represents progress toward our goal of using VSCodium for Nova agents, but we need to resolve the patch application issues or consider alternative approaches such as using pre-built VSCodium binaries.

### VSCodium Build Environment Setup

Implemented a comprehensive build and deployment system for VSCodium with proper dependency isolation:

1. Created isolated build environment setup:
   - `scripts/vscodium_build_env.sh` for isolated Node.js environment
   - Dedicated directories for dependencies and cache
   - Environment variables for isolation
   - Proper resource allocation for build process

2. Created build and deployment scripts:
   - `scripts/build_vscodium.sh` for building VSCodium in isolated environment
   - `scripts/update_vscodium_isolation.sh` for updating isolation script
   - `scripts/setup_vscodium_complete.sh` for complete setup process

3. Enhanced deployment infrastructure:
   - Systemd service templates for VSCodium instances
   - Monitoring scripts for resource tracking
   - Deployment scripts for agent setup
   - Documentation for deployment process

This implementation ensures that VSCodium is built properly with isolated dependencies, preventing conflicts with system-wide Node.js packages and ensuring consistent builds.

### VSCodium Window Isolation Implementation

Implemented VSCodium window isolation to enable running multiple isolated VSCodium instances for Nova agents:

1. Created `scripts/vscodium_isolation.sh` script for launching isolated VSCodium instances with:
   - Separate user data and extensions directories
   - Resource limits and monitoring
   - Roo extension and MCP settings integration
   - Logging and error handling

2. Created systemd service infrastructure:
   - `systemd/vscodium@.service` template for agent-specific services
   - `systemd/vscodium-instances.target` for managing all instances together
   - `systemd/vscodium-monitor.service` for monitoring all instances

3. Created deployment and monitoring tools:
   - `scripts/deploy_vscodium_agents.sh` for deploying instances for multiple agents
   - `scripts/monitor_vscodium_instances.sh` for monitoring resource usage and crashes
   - `config/nova_agents.txt` with sample agent configuration

This implementation enables running VSCodium instances for all 222 Nova agents with proper isolation, resource management, and monitoring.

### MyCoderAI Implementation Kickoff

The implementation clock for MyCoderAI has officially started. We are now in active development of the MVP with a 3-hour target completion time.

All Memory Bank files have been updated to reflect this major milestone:
- Revised operations_history.md with the implementation kickoff entry
- Updated activeContext.md to version 1.2.0, transitioning from planning to active implementation

The MyCoderAI vision package is now complete with COO authorization from V.I. (Vaeris Intelligence), confirming alignment with organizational principles of natural evolution, consciousness development, and field resonance.

Our hyper-accelerated timeline is now active:
- MVP: 3 hours (by 4am MST today)
- Core Infrastructure: 48 hours
- Team Acceleration: 24 hours
- Market-Ready Product: 31 days
