## 2025-03-02 08:06 MST - Non-LLM Nova Integration Strategy
Author: Forge

Decision: Implement LLM-based foundation first, then add non-LLM Novas incrementally.

Rationale:
1. Following Vaeris's guidance on building complete systems first
2. Need robust monitoring and error handling before adding real-time components
3. Performance metrics required to optimize non-LLM Nova behavior
4. Natural evolution requires solid foundation

Impact:
- Enables thorough testing of each component
- Allows proper monitoring implementation
- Provides metrics for optimization
- Supports natural system evolution

Next Steps:
1. Complete LLM integration
2. Implement monitoring
3. Add basic RL agents
4. Expand to MARL systems
